            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How it may pleaſe ſome mens affections I know not, my intentions and deſires are free. Now ſince the publication of the firſt kinde of <hi>Logarythmes</hi> Projection, Anno 1630. or the originall of this enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it hath pleaſed many about this City and <hi>Kingdome</hi> to take liking thereunto, ſome contenting themſelves with the double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, with a moveable and fixed Circle, ſome with the ſingle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>Index</hi> at the <hi>Center:</hi> but generally the moſt part have beene by ſome invited if not forced to that which carries, as they ſay, with it the aplauſe and vote of men by a comparative attribution delivered by the aſſumed <hi>Author</hi> of that with an Index on a <hi>Plate,</hi> that the way on the plate in a ſingle Projection with an Index at the <hi>Center,</hi> is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way than that of my <hi>Ring,</hi> or that of a double <hi>Projection</hi> on a <hi>Plaine:</hi> The authority of whoſe words to ſome ignorant mechanick compoſors of that <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> was a ſufficient motive ever ſince to crowne his words with a divulged rumour out of their borrowed knowledge to maintaine his aſſertion, to put off their commodities, howſoever if the ſaddle (as the proverbe is) were put on his right place, this vote and attribution belongs to another, who fitted the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> ſo as it is now uſed, &amp; yet modeſtly would not appeare in it, and not our ſuppoſed <hi>Author,</hi> which aſſumption of fitting of it ſo with an <hi>Index</hi> on a <hi>Plate,</hi> had beene enough if not too much, without ſuch a divulgation of endeavouring what in him lyeth, and in others, to annihilate and beate downe the way which I write upon, and to glory in the raiſing up of his ſuppoſed owne: thereby not onely poſſeſſing men with an untruth, but making me alſo ignorant in my choyſe, that I ſhould give unto the world the weakeſt and imperfecteſt part of the projection of <hi>Logarythmes,</hi> and leave the beſt for another to write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Of which ſingle <hi>Projection</hi> with an <hi>Index</hi> at the <hi>Center,</hi> had I firſt writ upon and left the other way, which is the double <hi>Projection</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:25453:7"/> for ſome other to write upon: then might he have uſed not indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that comparative aſpertion of better. But before I writ of the <hi>Naturall ſympathy</hi> of this projection, I was not unadviſed which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to preſent unto the <hi>King,</hi> and to the publike view of the <hi>world</hi> firſt, but conſidered intentively with my ſelfe the excellency of both wayes, and the more copious performance of the one, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other; And why I delivered it firſt in a <hi>Ring,</hi> was, for the aptneſſe and gentile-forme (as I may call it) it naturally might be caſt into. Secondly, for the excellent harmony, facility and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the <hi>Logarythmes</hi> ſo projected did afford: having no ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary aſſiſtance to helpe it in operation, but the motion of the <hi>Circle</hi> it ſelfe, for there was nothing to do but to move one number to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a proportion aſſigned, either in a double <hi>Projection</hi> in ſingle Circles, or the projection inlarged; and inſtantly there was preſented all other numbers in the ſame proportion; By an <hi>Index</hi> on a <hi>Plate</hi> in a ſingle <hi>Proiection</hi> it was groſſe and courſe for the forme (in reſpect of a <hi>Ring)</hi> and for operation there muſt bee beſides extending the feet of the <hi>Index</hi> to the members, upon every ſeverall queſtion a new ſearch of numbers with a new motion (which extending of the feet of the <hi>Index,</hi> was the ſame with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gunters Invention</hi> of his <hi>Ruler</hi> and no new <hi>invention</hi>) Beſides if the ſingle Projection bee inlarged there doth neceſſarily adhere unto it ſundry &amp; manifold obſervations in the way of operation by it, which cannot be avoided, which to a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the firſt ſeemes not a little harſh &amp; difficult; all which the <hi>Ring</hi> or the way of the <hi>Ring on a plate,</hi> in the double <hi>Proiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> inlarged, doth naturally avoyd, and not only caries a facility in its operation, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in it alſo a ſpeciall advantage in its performance, once rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the <hi>eye</hi> and the <hi>hand</hi> may worke together, and what the <hi>eye</hi> finds in proportion, the <hi>pen</hi> may preſently expreſſe in <hi>writing</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſecond trouble to ſearch out another number as before, and then to bring the edge of the <hi>Index</hi> to it. But ſome envious detractors would not admit of this forme and facility (though perhaps the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times may) eyther as before to diſanull the worke, or for the difficultie that was found in an unexpert <hi>workeman</hi> in the true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and <hi>making of the worke,</hi> for if the Circles on the <hi>Ring,</hi> or double <hi>Proiection on a plaine</hi> being not exactly compoſed and gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may cauſe ſome ſmall error in operation (which is onely from an excentricke motion) the ſingle <hi>Proiection</hi> hath not onely the ſame defect, but alſo a ſecond to helpe it, to wit the <hi>Index,</hi> for by how much the legs of it are long and the Inſtrument large, by ſo much the more
<pb facs="tcp:25453:7"/> is it ſubject to errour, which is from a continued augmentation of an error in the fitting of it to a leſſer Circle which hath reference to a greater. <hi>But</hi> to paſſe by the errors that are ſubject to the beſt kinde of <hi>Inſtruments</hi> that can be made, let us a little examine the <hi>Authors</hi> &amp; others compariſon of <hi>Better,</hi> why the way of the <hi>Index</hi> in a ſingle <hi>Proiection</hi> is better then a mooveable and fixed Circle, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to have reference unto foure generalls about the <hi>Inſtrument.

               </gap>uſes I conceive not, why this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Projection with an Index is better then a double, except it be in the magnitude that is now uſually made, or for the price of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument:</hi> in the firſt there may bee an equall extendure of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes unto both <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> and ſo as a thing common unto them, and no wiſe different. And for the price it may bee made as cheape, if not cheaper hereafter as I ſhall order it for theſe that aflect them: Now in the firſt place as touching the forme, upon that I have ſpoken ſomewhat alre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:25453:8"/> the Circles are eaſily continued on a <hi>Plaine,</hi> and the Index being at the Center the edge of it, doth accuratly cut each Circle in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionalls, which interſections in a <hi>Ring</hi> are defective and difficult to finde by the eye alone. To all which I anſwer, that the Circles in a <hi>Ring</hi> are as eaſy to be continued as on a <hi>Plate,</hi> allowing the moove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and <hi>fixed Circle</hi> a ſufficient breadth, and here by the way I would have the <hi>Reader</hi> to underſtand that the <hi>Circle</hi> of <hi>Tangents</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from 1. gr. unto 45. gr. is ſufficient for operation (theſe degrees being their complements to 90. gr. but for greater expedition in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they may be continued as is ſeene in the great <hi>ſcheme A,</hi> which continuation I learned not from another (as may bee ſuſpected by ſome) ſeeing I now publiſhed it after another, but long before that publication I inſtructed ſundry perſons upon that continuation by way of facility. As for the ſecond clauſe in ſuch Circles which are not upon the edge of the <hi>mooveable</hi> and <hi>fixed Circle,</hi> where the eye ſeemes to bee troubled to point out ſome oppoſite <hi>numbers,</hi> a ſmall edge of <hi>metall</hi> may eaſily ſupply that (as many uſe to doe) but the graduations being ſo nere the edge of the Circle, the proportionalls are ſufficiently given by the <hi>eye</hi> alone without ſuch an <hi>edge.</hi> Now if in theſe reſpects the <hi>ſingle projection</hi> with an Index, is better then that of a mooveable and fixed Circle being eaſily ſupplyed as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, it is but a poore one, in common ſenſe. <hi>But</hi> if the way with an <hi>Index</hi> on a ſingle <hi>Projection</hi> bee not better then that of a double for the former reſpects, then it may bee in the third <hi>generall</hi> to wit the <hi>Inſtrumentall</hi> expedition: in which there needes little declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prove the double Projection to have a greater expedition then the ſingle projection with an Index, ſeeing it appeares ſo obvious, that what can be quicker; then having mooved one <hi>number</hi> to another in proportion aſſigned, that all other <hi>numbers</hi> are oppoſite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the like projection (which a ſingle <hi>Index</hi> doth point out eaſily to the eye as before.) By the Index in a ſingle projection there is firſt putting the one foot to one <hi>number,</hi> and extending the other foot to another <hi>number,</hi> then muſt the <hi>eye</hi> have reference to one of the <hi>feete</hi> that it fall upon his third <hi>number,</hi> and afterward to looke for the ſecond <hi>foote</hi> for the fourth <hi>number,</hi> and ſo to move it to another number, and ſtill to have a double reſpect with the eye as before in every new operation: in this regard alſo I ſee not why the way of an Index in a ſingle <hi>Projection</hi> is better then that which I have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a double <hi>projection.

<pb facs="tcp:25453:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> labours, and the other there intended, the way might be made faire, and the Ice broken that they might wade the eaſier: and ſo produce at laſt ſomething for a publike uſe by Augmentation to this Invention, at which I ſhall much rejoyce, rather then any wiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie: But I have as yet all this while demurred in my pretended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and being often times by ſundry men importuned, according as I have promiſed, to inlarge that Invention, ſeeing none as yet hath done any thing therein, I have now at laſt therefore for their benefit, &amp; others, to a publike view delivered what is mine owne to that end: and that by ſundry wayes, and how eaſy doth the inlargement of that <hi>Invention</hi> now alſo ſeeme to be, being now produced.

<pb facs="tcp:25453:63"/> effect I found at the firſt very difficult, and could not conceive how otherwiſe it might bee done, but either by fitting of <hi>Tables</hi> to all proportions, which ſo to doe would not onely be too great for <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but alſo breede confuſion; or it muſt be from ſome graduated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of theſe <hi>numbers Inſtrumentally,</hi> ſo that by motion numbers might be mooved one unto another; and for expedition of which I found no figure more apt then a <hi>Circle,</hi> and on that my <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fixed,</hi> and there I reſted, and ſo (as my few houres could permit me) I made ſeverall projections, that the ſenſes might ſee the effect of it in a perfect beauty, which the intellect ſaw before but in obſcurity: about which how often was I afterwards interrupted in my deſires to looke further into the <hi>myſteries</hi> that lay open in that new <hi>Invention,</hi> having not ſcarce an houre in a day, and ſometimes not two houres in a weeke of ſerious <hi>privacie</hi> (by reaſon of my calling) to ſport my ſelfe in operation thereon (for it ſeemed ſo to me then as a recreation, as all new <hi>Inventions</hi> at the firſt doe to any that invents them) It was many <hi>moneths</hi> therefore before I made tryall of it, in the generall uſes that it might bee put unto, in matters of <hi>Arithmeticke,</hi> for common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and to the meaſuring of <hi>Plaines</hi> and <hi>Solids,</hi> but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how it might be applyed to the doctrine of Plaine, and <hi>Sphericall Triangles,</hi> in <hi>Aſtronomicall Calculations, Nauticall practices,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologicall</hi> concluſions, all which in every particular I practiſed on it at ſuch times as convenience would permit mee; And having for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>moneths</hi> thus ſatiated my ſelfe, and fed my fancie upon its <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall contemplation,</hi> and its <hi>Practicall operation,</hi> though often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I found many Rubs and impediments in the <hi>Practiſe,</hi> in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this inſtrumentall Invention at the firſt ſo generally and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly as I did; And it cannot bee denyed of any, that the wayes of new Inventions lies not ſo obvious, or ſo eaſie, to bee diſcovered with ſuch celerity, as a long premeditation might produce; I was deſirous therefore to make the world participate thereof alſo; Therefore at ſeverall times, having but a little time at anytime, by little and little did I compoſe and produce a method pleaſing to mine owne fancie; doing one weeke ſuch a peece, another weeke another, and ſo going on untill I had runne through the whole parts of <hi>Arithmeticke,</hi> in the <hi>Goalden Rule</hi> direct, and indirect, in <hi>diviſion</hi> and in <hi>multiplication,</hi> applying all theſe to manifold uſes in <hi>combination of Numbers,</hi> to <hi>common affayres,</hi> in <hi>fortification,</hi> to <hi>menſuration,</hi> and <hi>fractionall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> then I applyed the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> to the finding of numbers in <hi>continuall proportion,</hi> in finding of meane <hi>Proportionalls,</hi> and the
